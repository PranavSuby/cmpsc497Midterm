This project aims to do Named Entity Recognition, and recognize in a sentence which words are proper nouns.

The notebook file contains all the code for the RNN, while the pdf is the paper containing the information and the results from the RNN.

In order to reproduce the results, just run each of the cells in the notebook and install all the required packages. (Must use Python 3.11)
